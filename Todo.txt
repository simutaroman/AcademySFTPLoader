Minimum Marketing Feature (MMF)
+ Core class library which implemetns functionality to transfer files by SFTP
* Console application which is able to upload/download files from/to local directory to/from remote FTP directory by SFTP. Should use various arguments.
- WinForms user interface

User Stories (US) for current MMF:
* As a SDK-developer or technical writer I want to copy files from local dir to [ftp://]remotedir

Engineering tasks for current US:
* refactor configuring functionality for console app
* implement arguments (params) procesing

Todo on current tasks:
+ fix bugs with directory name trimming
+ Refactor code. Remove files and dirs transmitting code to core library. Create ContentManager class (see Terrasoft.FtpLoader).
+ refactor app.config and settings maintaining in code
+ develop arguments processing
+ fix space in path problem (crutch)
- Add clearing remote contents methods. It takes about 15 min to delete content whit aid of WinSCP


Future ideas or user stories:
Add event firing to LoadDirectoryContent of ContentManager class
